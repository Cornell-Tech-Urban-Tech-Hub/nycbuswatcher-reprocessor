# NYC MTA BusTime REPROCESSOR
- v1 2021 Apr 30
- Anthony Townsend <atownsend@cornell.edu>

### setup
Install `ijson` with pip, v3.1.4 and higher (via `pip install ijson`) are much faster than the latest conda build.

### data prep
This version operates on the SIRI response dumps created during the Oct 15, 2020 to May 2, 2021 period.


### usage
`python archive-reprocessor.py <optional:datadir> --dest [sqlite, mysql]`

#### how it works
The script will look in `<datadir>` for any files in the form of `daily-YYYY-MM-DD.gz` and starting form the earliest date does the following:

1. Unzips the archive to the current folder with the name structure `daily-YYYY-MM-DD.json.gz`
2. Begins loading the JSON as a stream, pulling out each `Siri` response, which represents a single route for a single point in time.
3. Parses each `MonitoredVehicleJourney` into a `BusObservation` class instance, and adds that to a database session. The session is committed after each `Siri` response is parsed.
4. Writes each day's data to a single `daily-YYYY-MM-DD.sqlite3` file.

Each daily file takes about 30 minutes to parse on a 2015 Mac Mini corei5.

##### `python sqlite3_to_df.py` (untested)

Crawls the same tree for the resulting `sqlite3` files and loads each into its own dataframe, returning a list, until you run out of patience or memory?
### why this was so complicated

1. The files are bigâ€”like 10Gb.
2. The way that `nycbuswatcher` creates the daily archives is nasty. All the `Siri` responses are concatenated into a single file, but as of 2021-04-30 I hadn't added line breaks! So its impossible to read in python without running out of memory, and even `awk` runs out of memory. So it ook a while to find `ijson` and use a lazy loading generator approach.




### process to pull the archives from server

make a filename list 

`cat response_filelist_all.txt | grep 2021-0[1-2]-* > filelist.txt`

check it and then construct something to batch copy from container to host

`docker cp nycbuswatcher_grabber_1:/app/data/daily-2021-01-24.gz .`

---> #todo dockerize it, add it to the stack, and reprocess the files on the same bus_data volume ina new folder?

### database migration notes

#### 2021.05.28
updated parser: `timestamp` not longer generated by parser from local server time, but parsed from  SIRI response `RecordedAtTime`. `server_timestamp` is unchanged.

#### 2021.05.02
updated parser to extract new fields: `passenger_count` and the 
`MonitoredCall` fields, `next_stop_id` `next_stop_eta` `next_stop_d_along_route`,`next_stop_d`
